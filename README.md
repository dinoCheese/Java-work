# Java-work
A compilation of some previous Java projects. These include

- Data Structures and Algorithms course notes and projects
- Boulder Dash, an early computer game 
- Pattern generator Game of Life
- Robotics code
- Resources to learn Java

Many of these are simple projects carried out for learning and education, fun or improvement.

# Data Structures and Algorithms

This was a course taken from undergrad but it's something I revisit. Several different projects are stored here. These include programs such as merge sort, binary trees and other projects. 
Additional projects include noughts and crosses with a GUI (featuring Douges) and some basic card and number games.

# Boulder dash

This game was used to incorperate OOP (Object Orientated Programming) into a take-home project for a programming project. The game was also known as rocks and diamonds - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder_Dash

The game is a nice challenge as it adds complicating elements such as gravity and roaming threats. 

# Pattern generator Game of Life

I started a group project to join elements of art and science where the audience can interact with it. The team was amazing and together we decided on making a pattern generator. To do that we decided on using Conway's game of life https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life
If we reflected the GOL output horizontally and vertically a pattern generator was created. We added colours too so there was even more variety. In order to make the code interactive we took a reading of volume using a microphone. The microphone input was used to determine how quickly the generations occured.

# Robotics code

This code is related to a robotics course, there are small bits of code from the course used to navigate a maze and do tricks.

# Resources to learn Java

This is a PDF of an extremely useful book that I used to learn Java and often revisit.
