 Assignment 1: Implement Mergesort for sorting an ArrayList, using both the Comparator ADT
 and generics. (The comparator interface is provided by the Java SDK, don't write it yourself!)

 What is the average runtime for a list of Doubles of length 1,000, 10,000 and 100,000?

Assignment 2: Now implement a second version of Mergesort that uses Bubblesort to sort sublists
of less than 20 elements. Compare the running time of this version of the algorithm to the first
version.
